										<h2>What is Acupunture?</h2>
									</header>

									<p>Acupuncture has been a Chinese art of healing for over 2500 years in China and is an important component of Chinese health 
care system, which has become popular in many countries particularly during the past four decades.</p>

									<h3>How Does Acupunture Work?</h3>
									<p>By inserting very fine, sterile needles into specific points of the body, Chi or ‘vital energy’ flows within its meridians to 
stimulate and improve the immune and healing systems. According to the World Health Organization, there are 47 specific 
common conditions treatable by Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture. These include:</p>

									<p><strong>Respiratory Disorders</strong> such as the common cold, bronchitis, and bronchial asthma (mainly in children and adults when uncomplicated).</p>
									<p><strong>Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders</strong> such as acute sinusitis, acute rhinitis (runny nose), acute tonsillitis, toothache
post-extraction pain), gingivitis, and pharyngitis.</p>
									<p><strong>Eye Disorders</strong> such as acute conjunctivitis, central retinitis, nearsightedness in children, and uncomplicated</p>
									<p><strong>Gastrointestinal Disorders</strong> such as diarrhea, constipation, spasms of the throat and diaphragm, hiccups,
gastroptosis (abnormal lowering of the stomach), gastric hyperacidity, chronic duodenal ulcer (for pain relief), acute 
duodenal ulcer (without complications), acute and chronic colitis, acute bacillary dysentery, and paralytic ileus (blockage of 
the small bowel – often occurring after an abdominal operation).</p>
									<p><strong>Neurological and Muscular Disorders</strong> such as headaches, migraines, trigeminal neuralgia, facial palsy (when
begins with three to six months after onset), numbness and paralysis following a stroke, peripheral neuropathies (loss of 
feeling in the outer nerves), Meniere’s disease (ear problem which causes dizziness and vertigo), neurogenic bladder 
dysfunction, bed-wetting, intercostal neuralgia (pains in the ribs), neck pain, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, sciatica, low 
back pain, and osteoarthritis.</p>
									<p>The National Institutes of Health has concluded that there is clear-cut evidence that acupuncture is useful in treating such 
conditions as post-operative pain and the nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy or chemotherapy. In addition, it is 
beneficial as an adjunctive to standard biomedical care in the treatment of stroke, headache and chronic back pain, as well 
as addiction, menstrual cramps, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel syndrome and asthma.</p>
